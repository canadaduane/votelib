* Chain Vote: Easy, Fair Voting for the 21st Century

  Chain Vote implements Maximum Majority Voting [[http://wiki.electorama.com/wiki/Maximum_Majority_Voting]] and
  Delegable Proxy Voting [[http://fc.antioch.edu/~james_green-armytage/vm/proxy.htm]].
  
  That's why Chain Vote is "fair".  The "easy" part is coming soon.
